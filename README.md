# etch-a-sketch

This was an implementation of an etch-a-sketch using a NodeMCU microcontroller
board, and some rotary encoder modules, plus an accellerometer for shake-to-clear
verisimilitude.

This was done at Futurice Code Camp 2017. There will probably be a blog post
about it here: http://futurice.com/blog
